## Getting Started

As you advance through your coding journey you will need to employ a number of tools that go along with software development.

In this guide, you will be provided with a list of tools and resources to jump-start your learning process.

### Git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. ([source](https://git-scm.com/]))

In our first meeting, we discovered that while most of the group already had a basic introduction to coding most had very little experience with Git and version control systems. It was immediately realized that this was an essential first lesson for anyone looking to participate in CodeClub activities.

[try.github.io](https://try.github.io/) is a fantastic introduction to using Git. Once you run through this tutorial you'll know everything you'll need to know in order to use git and push files to CodeClub's Github repositories.

### Text Editor
In order to write software you'll need a text editor. You may have heard of editors like Vi, Vim, Emacs, Nano, Sublime and Atom. There is no correct answer to the question of which one you should use. Your choice will come down to personal choice. [Vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and Nano are usual command line text editors. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) are standalone desktop text editors.

Sublime is not open source and does require a purchase, which is why Atom is likely a better choice for your coding needs.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free, highly customizable cross-platform text editor brought to you by the friendly folks at Github.
